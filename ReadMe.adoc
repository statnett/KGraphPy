= KGraphPy – Knowledge Graph DataOps for Python
v0.1.0-alpha, 2025-03-03
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

**KGraphPy** is a Python library for working with **knowledge graphs on top of RDFLib**.

It provides **DataOps-oriented extensions** for standards-based graph data, with a particular focus on **CIM / CGMES–style model exchange**, change management, and dataset packaging.  
KGraphPy is designed to complement RDFLib by adding practical capabilities needed in real-world data and model pipelines, while remaining fully compatible with RDFLib’s APIs and ecosystem.

KGraphPy is intended to serve as a foundational building block for higher-level **DataOps and ModelOps workflows**, including validation, verification, analytics, and human-in-the-loop correction.

== Scope and Focus

KGraphPy focuses on:

- Working with **RDF-based knowledge graphs** in Python
- Supporting **standards-based data exchange**, with CIM / CGMES as the primary initial focus
- Providing **interchange, packaging, and change-management support** commonly required in operational environments
- Integrating cleanly with schema, validation, and analytics tooling

While CIM / CGMES is the primary driver, KGraphPy is designed to be reusable across other standards and profiles, including IEC 61850, BIM/IFC, GeoSPARQL-based datasets, EU SEMIC profiles, and Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).

== Core Capabilities

KGraphPy builds directly on RDFLib and provides:

- In-memory knowledge graph handling (and supported backends via RDFLib)
- Parsing and serialisation of RDF in multiple syntaxes (RDF/XML, Turtle, TriG, JSON-LD, etc.)
- SPARQL 1.1 querying over local graphs and remote endpoints via RDFLib stores
- Seamless integration with schema and validation tooling such as *pySHACL* and *LinkML*

== Interoperability and DataOps Extensions

KGraphPy adds practical DataOps-oriented extensions, including:

- **CIMXML support**  
  Handling of CIM RDF/XML conventions used in IEC CIM / CGMES exchanges

- **CIMXML header support**  
  Explicit handling of metadata and header graphs as defined in CGMES packaging

- **DifferenceSet support**  
  - Creation, parsing, and application of CIM DifferenceSets  
  - Comparison of model versions (base vs. changed state)  
  - Incremental exchange and change-oriented DataOps workflows

- **Dataset-level metadata support**  
  Support for modern **DCAT-3–style dataset headers**, enabling explicit dataset metadata graphs

- **Compressed artefact handling**  
  Read/write support for compressed packages (e.g. ZIP), including common *profile instance set bundle* layouts

- **Future-ready packaging**  
  Designed to accommodate evolving CIM exchange formats, including JSON-LD and packaging

== Relationship to Other Libraries

KGraphPy is intentionally lightweight and composable:

- **RDFLib** provides the core RDF graph engine and SPARQL capabilities
- **LinkML** can be used to define schemas, profiles, and generate typed Python artefacts

KGraphPy does not replace RDFLib; it **extends it with operational and standards-oriented capabilities**.

== Licensing

KGraphPy is released under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

This allows free use, modification, and redistribution in open-source, research, and commercial contexts, subject to the terms of the license.

== Accreditation

KGraphPy is built **on top of RDFLib**, and we explicitly acknowledge the RDFLib project and its contributors for providing the foundational RDF graph capabilities that make this library possible.

- RDFLib project: https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib

In addition, we acknowledge and accredit:

- link:https://cimug.ucaiug.org/[UCA CIMug]  
- The teams responsible for the development of **Common Information Model (CIM) for Electricity**, which define the information models, application profile and exchange format that are suppored by  KGraphPy’s interoperability features.

KGraphPy builds on this work but remains an independent, open-source Python library.
